This event-tracking app allows members to sign in and view a feed with all the current club events posted in chronlogical order. Members can click on the events to view details such as the event creator, date, description, photo, as well as RSVP for the event and view other members who have RSVPed. In addition, as other members post new events, the feed will be updated in realtime using the Firebase backend implemented to store all the events. This creates a more streamlined ways for members to communicate and keep track of club events.
